# Parquet files viewer
This is a small Python script that allows you to view parquet files.

## Installation
From a WindowsPower terminal:
1. Change directory to where you want to run it from 

2. Clone the repository
* git clone https://github.com/alshaffir/parquet_viewer.git

2. cd parquet_viewer
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python.exe ./run.py

## Note
There is no spinner/progress-bar/loader while the file is uploaded. So, I recommended first loading a small 
parquet file (a few KBs) just to see if all is working.
